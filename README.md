# Lost-and-found
This website idea came up when I was brainstorming for an idea during OctaHacks 3.0. This website can be used by the cops to list the lost items reported to them by the citizens and the citizens can use this website to check if their lost item is listed and if found, collect it from the respective police station. 

To have a glimpse on how this website works watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qmCKdrBzlI

Since heroku took down the free hosting service, the site is no longer hosted anywhere.

3. Once all packages are installed you are ready to run the application. Type 'py app.py' in the terminal and hit enter.

## Operations that can performed
### BY COP:
1. To access the dashboard click on "I'm a COP" in the landing page.

3. Once logged in you will be redirected to the item entry form where you can fill details as provided by the citizen who reported the lost item.
4. By clicking the 'Update Items' option one can also update the item that is added by him/her and if the lost item is collected by its respective owner the cop can also delete the item from the lost items list.

### BY CITIZEN:
1. To access the lost items list click on "I'm a CIVILIAN" in the landing page.
2. From the list displayed the citizen can find whether their lost item is reported to any stations. 
3. If they find their item they have the details of the station where their item is reported and contact them and get it back.
