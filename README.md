# Lost-and-found
Hosting a site built using flask on heroku is a mess haha. 23 out of my 34 commits where made just to make the site work properly when hosted. But finally completed it. Click on this link https://lost-and-found-pranith.herokuapp.com/ and let me know how it is. Cheers! 


So this is a site that cops can use when people report them with lost items. First the cop registers his station and logs in. Later he enter the details of the lost item that is reported to him. He even has the option to update and delete the item. Civilians or people can like I'm a civilian to see the list and find whether their lost item is reported to any stations. If they find their item they have the details of the station where their item is reported and contact them and get it back.
